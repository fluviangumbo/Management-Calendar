current functionality: weve got an input for tasks, saving is still being implemented. taskInput is done
 with the add_task anchor in the top left. to view further details on a given day the secondary button
  next to the "day" (e.g. monday) redirects to a secondary page where details will be rendered.
  important note: when using this and considering how and what to implement with this new page, check the url. you'll note it should say "http://127.0.0.1:5500/day.html?day=Monday". day=monday being the important bit.
