# Management Calendar
### KU Full Stack Bootcamp Project 1 Group 2

## Description

This calendar is a webpage designed to help project managers organize and oversee their projects on a weekly basis. It provides a clear overview of tasks and who should be working on them, making it easier to assign tasks to team members and monitor their progress. This calendar is suited for project managers who need to keep track of a variety of tasks and teams and ensure they stay on schedule. It is a simple tool you plan your week effectively and store a persisting record of what you aim to accomplish and who is helping you make it happen.

## How to Access

Since our project is a web application, you only need to visit --URL_HERE-- to get started!

## Usage

The user will go to the webpage and the calendar will load all previously input data from local storage. If no prior data exists, then the calendar will display an empty view of the week. Each day will link to a separate page that is a spotlight of the tasks that are set for that day and the employees set to work on them.

You can add new employees and tasks at any time, but please make sure that you follow the instructions when inputting your data. You can link employees to tasks and then use the different views of the application to see your weekly tasks and project hours broken down how you prefer. Please refer any suggestions to improve the site to the email address listed in the contact section below!
